	<footer><center><p>We are an organization who seek to help parents and their children through services such as art, dance and nanny services. 
	This is a collaborative effort from the ladies of The Sitter Club and Creatively Wild</p></center></footer>

	<footer><center><p>The Sitter Club by Nic &amp; Syd is a babysitter referral service founded by two of NYC’s top notch sitters. Our objective through communication and compatibility is to create a match between family and sitter. 
	This connection is key when searching for your family’s childcare and reducing your everyday stress. We would love to help you find the ideal fit for your home. You’re busy enough, let us do the work.</p></center></footer>

	<footer><center><p>Located in the heart of Dumbo, Creatively WILD Art Studio (CWAS) offers innovative art classes for all age groups and socioeconomic classes. 
	For the past seven years, Creatively WILD has provided art classes, scholarship programs and free public art programs to families city-wide. We know no cultural or racial boundaries; we believe art is a universal language that inspires a shared love of beauty.</p></center></footer>
